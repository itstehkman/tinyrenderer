# tinyrenderer
A miniature graphics library, solely built to understand how graphics and OpenGL work.

I am following the tutorial created by ssloy, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer). 
His tutorial is absolutely brilliant and is a great way to understand how graphics cards and OpenGL work together.
